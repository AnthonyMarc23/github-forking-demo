Hello. You have forked and cloned my repo. Now you can edit the repository in any way. If you want to make sure this repo is capable of receiving updates, follow the steps below:


Step 1: Add the original repo's information
In your terminal, type: git remote add upstream https://github.com/adhire/github-forking-demo.git

Step 2: Check to see if the connection was created
In your terminal, type: git remote -v

** If you see your repo and my repo, move to step 3. If not, ask for help. **


Step 3: Fetch the updates from the original repo (the repo you forked) In your terminal, type: 
git fetch upstream


Step 4: Checkout to your master branch and merge the upstream/master. In your terminal, type:

Any time the original branch makes an update, you can follow steps 3 and 4. If you want to push your local changes to your GitHub repo, you simply run these commands in order:

git push origin/master
